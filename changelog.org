* v0.4.8
- allow overwriting ToT calibration, S-curves in ~databaseTool~ when
  adding a chip. That way one can change the ToT calibration, rerun
  the ~databaseTool~ and the new file will be used successfully.
* v0.4.7
Introduce the notion of 'constraints' for run periods in the InGrid
database.
A constraint allows to decide which input file maps to what run period
based on any additional attributes found in a chip group of a specific
run. For example the threshold of a chip.
Read the following document to get an idea:
[[./resources/ChipCalibrations/Tpx3_Test_Constraints/README.org]]

*NOTE*: As part of introducing the notion of 'constraints' for a distinction
of different run periods, the ~databaseTool~ of the InGrid database
has received minor *breaking* usage changes. It is now a
multi-command tool. See the updated README at
[[https://github.com/Vindaar/TimepixAnalysis/tree/master/InGridDatabase]].
* v0.4.6
- use ~ToA_combined~ for the ToA data for Tpx3 (@magruber PR #60)
- add ~fTOA~ data to Tpx3 data (@magruber PR #60)
- fix data type of TOA data for Tpx3 (PR #60)    
* v0.4.5
- clean up checks for raw & reco runs already in file
- add checks for existing run in output file of
  ~raw_data_manipulation~ for Timepix3 data.
- add ~forceRunNumber~ to allow overwriting the run number for a
  Timepix3 input HDF5 file. That input file must only have a single
  run.
- fix code when calling ~raw_data_manipulation~ and ~reconstruction~
  multiple times on the same output file where, if already present
  (and ~--overwrite~ set) we would potentially still only *add* to the
  existing dataset instead of overwriting it. Overwrites datasets by
  default now in both tools.
- fix issue in gas gain slicing due to ~readDsets~ causing trouble on
  datamancer ~v0.4.6~ due to ~innerJoin~ behavior. Upstream fix in
  datamancer (~v0.4.7~)
- add informational output if attempted to compute gas gain vs charge
  calibration fit for a single run.
- add limit calculation tool that allows for adjusting all parameters
  from CL arguments or config file, [[file:Analysis/ingrid/basic_limit_calc.nim]].  
  
** Other misc changes:
- [reco] print info about existing gas gain calc if skipping
- [reco] improve info output of polya, gas gain checking
- refactor checks for already processed runs in `reconstruction`
- [misc] add note about import for `docCommentAdd`
- [bin] add symlink for tpx3RawToPlots
- [lock] update nimble lockfile
- [resources] add bkg rate for 2017/18, MLP95, FADC, scinti, line vetoes
- [plots] make outputting a CSV of background rate proper feature

* v0.4.4
- build NLopt without Python etc bindings to remove numpy / pip dependency
* v0.4.3
- For charge calibration and gas gain calculation we now write to the
  log file which run period was actually used and also write it to the
  output H5 files.
- fix ~buildTpa~ to expand home dir in file names
- fix ~buildTpa~ to throw an error if a required tool is not found
- change default to not clone automatically in ~buildTpa~
- expand dependencies section in README
- add note about requiring to install ~weave~ first in README
- update FADC test ~tReadFadc~ to partially make it work (it compiles,
  numbers need to be updated & we need a full run of FADC files for
  pedestal)
- update InGrid test (passes again)
- update raw data test (need to update JSON)
* v0.4.2
- add Github Actions CI and rewrite the build tool for simpler
  building of the binaries. The dependencies are now locked using a
  lockfile.
- update the README
* v0.4.1
- update some dependencies
- fix the nimble file
* phd_rc0
- 'release candidate' version that I used for all the results in my
  PhD thesis
